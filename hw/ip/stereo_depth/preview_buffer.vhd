-- preview_buffer: a PS-readable copy of one camera's captured frame.
--
-- The real frame buffers cannot serve this: both ports are already spoken
-- for (camera writes on A, disparity engine reads on B), and a dual-port
-- BRAM has no third port. Time-sharing port B with AXI would stall the
-- disparity engine at unpredictable moments, so this takes a separate tap
-- off the same capture stream instead.
--
-- Storage is deliberately packed 8 pixels per 32-bit word. Captured pixels
-- are only 4 bits, so storing one per byte would waste 4x the BRAM -- and
-- at 40/60 blocks already used by the rest of the design, two byte-per-pixel
-- preview buffers would not have fit. Packed, each buffer is 4096 words
-- (32 Kbit) and both together cost ~8 blocks.
--
-- Host-side unpacking: pixel i lives in word i/8, nibble i%8, least
-- significant nibble first.
